This is a machine learning tool designed to aid musicians in composing sheet music. Musicians can input a series of starter notes as the melody, and the tool will suggest complimentary notes in SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) format. If time permits, the tool will also allow users to prompt the model with different genres and instruments, enabling musicians to further tailor the tool to their specific needs.

Pipeline:
- Data preprocessing
- Create a model (NN)
- Train the model
- Finetune the model
- Test the model
- Implement other approaches
